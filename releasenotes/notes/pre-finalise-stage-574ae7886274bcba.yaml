    A ``pre-finalise`` stage is added that runs outside the chroot and
    before the ``finalise`` stage.  For example, this may be useful
    for mounting external resources that are used inside the chroot
    during the ``finalise`` stage, but do not need to be distributed
    in the final image such as build-time caches.
