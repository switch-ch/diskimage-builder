    You would need to modify your ``DIB_CLOUD_IMAGES`` and possibly
    ``SHA256SUMS`` variables if you were using them to build Ubuntu with
    elements/ubuntu: ``DIB_CLOUD_IMAGES`` would need to contain URL with
    path, and ``SHA256SUMS`` would not now neccesarily point to
    ``$DIB_RELEASE/current/`` directory.
